								<h3 id="faq-1"><strong>Q.</strong> How much money can I make?</h3>

								<p>
									Payment is based on the number of trees you plant each day. The tree price times the number of trees will be your daily earnings. The price per tree ranges from 5 to 50 cents. This depends on the contract made and the contract takes in account the conditions of the plot to planted in and how hard it will be. Most contracts are fair and the average earnings for experienced planters will be around $250. Motivated and in shape workers can earn more than this per day.
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-2"><strong>Q.</strong> How hard is this job?</h3>
								<p>
									Tree planting is a challenging job that requires a lot of motivation and physical fitness. Trees are carried on a special harness strapped around your waist and shoulders. Planters can carry anywhere from 90 to 200 seedlings at a time planting across uneven and hazerdous terrain. If you aren't in the best physical fitness don't worry you can still come plant for us but you won't earn as much since you are paid per tree. 
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong> Do you accept backpackers?</h3>
								<P>Yes</P>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong> Do I need a car?</h3>

								<p>Having a car would benefit you but is not an absolute requirment for this position. We will provide your transportation to work (you do not need to pay for this). We will work in rural parts of NSW and ACT so public transport will not always be available to you so please keep this in mind. </p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong> How many trees are planted per day?</h3>
								<p>
									This is hard say because it depnds on the plot of land, experience, physical fitness and many more factors. An experienced planter can plant over over 3000 - 5000 trees in a day. While novice planters will be planting near 1000 to 3000 trees a day.
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong> Do I need to be in shape?</h3>
								<p>
									You do not need to be in the best shape of your life to be a tree planter but it would help you earn more money. While a good level of atheletic ability would help you out you don't need to be a olympic athelete here. Workers have described tree planting as one of the hardest jobs they have ever done. 
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>


								<h3 id="faq-7"><strong>Q.</strong> How will accommodation be set up?</h3>
								<p>
									We arrange accomodation depneding on where we get the contracts from. For example, when we have contracts near Tumut you will be staying at the Riverglad Caravan Park Campground. This accomodation is around $100 a week. Check out there website for my information at <a href="https://www.riverglade.com.au">https://www.riverglade.com.au</a>. If contracts are near Canberra we will have you stay at our rental in the suburb of Florey. We work hard to get you the best accomodation at the cheapest price. 
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>


								<h3 id="faq-8"><strong>Q.</strong> When is the Planting Season in Australia?</h3>
								<p>

									Virtually all year long but we have 2 distinct planting seasons in Australia.
									<hr>
									Summer season (January-April) and the Winter season (May-September/October).
									<br><br>
									Our Summer season is drastically dictated by rainfall or lack thereof and start dates can move forward or be pushed back accordingly. If you are thinking of coming to plant here for our Summer season please keep that in mind.
									<br><br>
									Our Winter season on the other hand, starts no later than June 1st and continues through until September/October. However, we have been known to plant trees in any month throughout the year. It all depends on demand and if the weather is co-operating. Our Winter is by far our larger contracts, unfortunately coinciding with the North American season.
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-9"><strong>Q.</strong> What are the differences between planting in Australia and North America?</h3>
								<p>

									Conventional Bush Camps are NOT utilised here in Australia. The locations of summer works tend to be  HOT and WET and our winters remain COLD (0-5° C) at night. It takes time to adjust to our summer heat. This makes tent life somewhat impracticle and the mobility of crews and equipment is also essential.
									<br><br>

									Accommodation is usually caravan parks or houses and is always close to a town centre. The accommodation will always have a kitchen/cooking facilities as we do not provide cooks in Australia. Planters are required to purchase and prepare their own food. We provide the means to acquire provisions when needed.
									<br><br>

									Planters are paid every week.
									<br><br>

									The heat. It takes getting used to, no question. Please wear a wide brimmed hat and use sun screen. The Australian sun is one of the worst in terms of UAV and there is a high rate of skin cancer in Auatralia compared to other countries.
									<br><br>

									Planters work the block with the rest of the crew, NOT in their own pieces as  we are very limited with delivery capacity in Australia. This is due to the seedling stock types. Australia does not provide trees in boxes but rather trays that can vary in size from 40 to 63 seedlings per tray.
									<br><br>

									Due to contractual restrictions, trees must be planted directly from the trays that are attached to planting harnesses and are not able to be ‘bagged up’ using conventional planting bags
									<br><br>

									Ground prep can vary significantly within any given block and the tree price is reflected accordingly. Tree price varies on steepness of slope as well.
									<br><br>

									‘Area planting’ in uncultivated ground does not occur very often. Most uncultivated ground is to be planted in straight lines adhering to predetermined interrow and between tree spacing. This is done by either following windrows or flaglines.
									<br><br>

									We provide the Planting Belts
									<br><br>

									‘Walk-ins’ are not common practice in Australia
									<br><br>

									Hard hats are NOT required PPE in Australia. Wide brim hats in the summer, steel cap, lace up boots and hi-visibility clothing (provided) is required PPE.

								<h3 id="faq-10"><strong>Q.</strong> Is there only tree planting work?</h3>
								<p>
									On some contracts you will need to do fertilizing work. This is similar to tree planting, but with different tools. Granular fertilizer is carried in a backpack and planted in a hole next to the planted tree. It too is piece rate and you can expect to earn about the same amount of money as planting.

								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>


								<h3 id="faq-11"><strong>Q.</strong> Does this job count towards my 88 days?</h3>
								<p>
									Yes it does. You can use the pay slips provided for your second year visa application.
								</p>

								<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

								<h3 id="faq-12"><strong>Q.</strong> Is tree planting work weather dependent?</h3>
								<p>
									Yes it is. <br><br>
									Tree planting is weather dependent, and there may be times when we are asked to stop planting temporarily until conditions are favourable. You can expect one or two of these stoppages on most, but not all jobs. They range from one or two days to a week or even more in extreme cases. Weather conditions are very unpredictable, making tree planting contracts equally unpredictable- it is very important to us that you understand this aspect of the job, and that you commit to completing the whole contract or at least three months before we take you on. In ideal situations we work five days a week (Monday - Friday) and have weekends off. 
									<br><br>
									You will need to be able to work in all weather conditions and at all times of the day and even at night sometimes, as we try and work when conditions are most favourable – not for us necessarily, but for the trees. Good tree planters need to be motivated, hard working and tough.

								<h3 id="faq-13"><strong>Q.</strong>How can I prevent injuries during this job?</h3>
									<p>It is better to show you then write it out here. So we provided videos below to help you prevent any aches and pains.</p>
